# What is Zabbix?

Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution.

Zabbix is software that monitors numerous parameters of a network and the health and integrity of servers. Zabbix uses a flexible notification mechanism that allows users to configure e-mail based alerts for virtually any event. This allows a fast reaction to server problems. Zabbix offers excellent reporting and data visualisation features based on the stored data. This makes Zabbix ideal for capacity planning.

## Zabbix Dockerfiles

This repository contains **Dockerfile** of [Zabbix](https://zabbix.com/) for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)'s [automated build](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/zabbix/) published to the public [Docker Hub Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/).
